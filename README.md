## Additional Thoughts and Considerations

### Test Coverage
While the current tests cover the basic CRUD operations, there are many other aspects of the application that could be tested. For example, we could add tests for edge cases, such as creating a product with a very long name or a very large price. We could also add tests for the application's performance and security.

### Test Data Management
In the current solution, test data is created and deleted as part of the tests. This is a good practice as it ensures that the tests are not dependent on the existing data in the database. However, it would be beneficial to have a more robust system for managing test data, such as a separate test database or a way to reset the database to a known state before each test run.

### Continuous Integration
The tests are currently run manually, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Integrating the tests into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline would allow them to be run automatically whenever changes are made to the code. This would help catch any regressions early and ensure that the application is always in a releasable state.

### Test Reporting
While the current solution logs the results of each test to the console, it would be beneficial to have a more detailed test report. This could include information such as the number of tests passed and failed, the time taken for each test, and any error messages. There are many tools available that can generate such reports, such as Allure or Extent Reports.

### Code Review and Refactoring
Regular code reviews and refactoring can help maintain the quality of the test code. This includes following best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code, as well as keeping the tests up to date as the application evolves.
